"""
Automate LUKS passphrase entry for a VM booting with Plymouth.

Vendored from projectbluefin/iso (src/luks-unlock.py, Apache-2.0) so Utah's
end-to-end test does not depend on a checkout of that repository. One change:
the QEMU monitor is driven through a plain UNIX socket rather than socat,
which is not packaged for this platform and cannot be installed here.

Plymouth renders the passphrase prompt on the EFI framebuffer (not the serial
console), so we cannot detect it via serial output.  Instead we detect the
Plymouth prompt by analysing QEMU screendumps (PPM files):

  - Plymouth passphrase prompt is a static, nearly all-black screen.
  - We wait for the screendump MD5 hash to stabilise (stop changing) after
    the framebuffer has first shown any non-zero content (OVMF/boot rendered).
  - Then inject keystrokes via virsh send-key (libvirt) or QEMU HMP sendkey.

Usage:
  libvirt mode:  luks-unlock.py libvirt <vm-name> <passphrase> <mac-address>
  qemu mode:     luks-unlock.py qemu    <monitor-sock> <passphrase> <serial-log>

Exit codes:
  0 — passphrase sent and boot succeeded (display re-stabilised after unlock)
  1 — error (timed out, passphrase prompt never appeared, etc.)
  2 — passphrase sent but boot resulted in emergency shell (issue #270 reproduced)
